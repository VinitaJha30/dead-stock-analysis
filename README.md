# 🧊 Dead Stock Analysis – Python Jupyter Notebook

This project explores **dead stock (non-moving inventory)** using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to identify products that are sitting idle in inventory, analyze stock movement patterns, and generate insights that help reduce holding costs and improve procurement decisions.

## 📊 Key Features

- Identify slow-moving and non-moving SKUs
- Calculate total value locked in dead stock
- Perform EDA on inventory trends and demand fluctuations
- Create actionable visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Lay the foundation for inventory reduction strategies

## 📁 Files Included

- `Dead stock analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Anaconda)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
